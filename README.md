# **Ethernaut Walkthrough**

This is just a simple walkthrough of the Ethernaut smart contract security challenges. Would highly recommend that you do it on your own until you want to smash your monitors. **DON'T, smash your monitor,** then come back to this for help getting unstuck and figure out the next parts.

I haven't been able to figure out challenge 19, Alien Codex. If you have an answer please let me know, thank you.

* Note, that you will need to use Remix IDE to deploy contracts to the Rinkeby Test Network to interact with the contract instance. You'll need test eth to do so. [Go here for some.](https://faucet.rinkeby.io/)  

### **HUGE** shout out to these other developers. I would have not been able to get through these challenges without their help.
